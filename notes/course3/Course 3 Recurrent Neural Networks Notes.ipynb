    "    \n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs mid-90s) addressed the vanishing gradient problem \n",
    "* some signals (state variables) are kept fixed by using gates and reintroduced (or not) at an appropraite time in the future \n",
    "* arbitrary time intervals can be represented and temporal dependnecies can be captured  "
